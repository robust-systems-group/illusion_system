# Raw data

There are 3 types of folders for each workload: `no_resilience`, `de`, and `final`. 

`final` represents the final state of the memory for `de` experiments (used for discovering temporary write failures). `lstm_final_c0` represents the final state of C0 (on physical chip 2), since chip0 experiments were run and stored seperately due to hardware errors.
