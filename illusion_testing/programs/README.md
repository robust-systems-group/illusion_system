# Compiled data and program memories

Each of the workloads in `c_models_msp` was compiled down onto the illusion system.

Data and program memories are given as `dmem.mem` and `pmem.mem`. 

The file path name indicates the variables set during compilation. The tested programs are the `MODE*/NOPATH/NONVNOTIME/CHIP*`
